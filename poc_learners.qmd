title: "Defining learners"
---

Here we present a framework for conducting a PA proof-of-concept. The framework focuses on specifying and comparing "learners."

A **learner** is a combination of:

1.  *A predictor set:* a set of measures that are available at the prediction timepoint and that are potentially predictive of the outcome of interest.

2.  *A modeling approach*: a method for combining and weighting measures, e.g., regression or a particular machine learning algorithm.

Machine learning algorithms automate model building using a series of steps that are driven by patterns in the data - rather than relying on functional forms specified by an analyst. Examples include decision trees, random forests, stepwise regression, support vector machines, among many others.
