The department of social services already had a practice of providing
extra intervention to those clients who needed them most. These
included:

-   calling clients to check in,

-   offering extra casework sessions, and

-   extra workshops to help with job search and job skills.

With limited staff and financial resources, the department wanted to
deliver services to who needed them the most. However, the department
thought that their existing approach for identifying those clients could
be improved by distilling a wide range of potentially predictive
measures into a single "risk score."

A few things to note:

-   They did not want, nor did the project team recommend, for the risk
    scores to **replace** their decision-making process.

-   Instead, the risk scores could potentially provide a valuable piece
    of information - if we could validate good predictive performance
    and minimal bias.

-   The department planned to train caseworkers to how to interpret and
    incorporate the risk score into their decisionmaking and
    prioritizing.

-   The department also wanted to look at how risk scores varied across
    and within populations served by offices throughout the state. This
    could help them understand which offices were more in need of
    support for reaching out to clients and for planning workshops.

This information about how the department plans to use the information
can guide how we scope the predictive analytics projects.

Remember, we also want to frequently check-in with our ethical
considerations. What ethical considerations do we want to be careful
about as we proceed?
