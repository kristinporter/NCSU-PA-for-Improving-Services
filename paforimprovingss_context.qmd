Before embarking on a PA project, it is value to assess whether it is the right approach at the right time for the setting. Here are a some key considerations to determine if PA is a good fit.

#### Will PA provide new and actionable information? 

-   Do we anticipate that the PA findings will information that more reliable, more frequent or easier to understand than current information available?

-   How will findings from PA be communicated and used, and by whom?

-   How frequently to PA findings need to be updated to be continuously actionable?

#### Are there plans and buy-in for acting on insights that come out of PA? 

-   Is there sufficient leadership and commitment from the institution?

-   Is there capacity for interpreting, communicating and and acting on PA results? How will findings be communicated?

-   Are there plans for how program services will be changed or introduced based on PA results?

-    To what extent does decision making and service provision currently rely on perceptions or data-driven findings? Are data-driven findings in general, and PA findings more specifically, trusted and used? If not, are there plans for addressing practice and culture to support change?

-   Are there structural or process factors that impede or foster the use predictive analytics (such as dedicated data teams) or the use of results (such as dashboard systems)?

#### Data quality and systems

-   Is there sufficient data that are readily accessible?

-   Are the data sufficiently documented and understood so that reliable measures can be created for PA?

-   Is there sufficient capacity for investigating and depoying PA with existing analytic systems, software and staffing?

#### Potential risks

-    Have their been sufficient processes for identifying potential risks?

-   Are there systems or processes in place to make sure ethical issues are attended to throughout a PA project?
