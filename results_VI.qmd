Related to the previous question is: What are the most important
predictors in my model? However, compared to the previous question about
understanding who has low or high predicted probabilities, this question
more specifically points to the model. The question takes us into a wide
variety of methods focused on "variable importance" (VI).

### The value of variable importance

VI is helpful for understanding and explaining a predictive model. VI
methods also answer a set of related questions. Sometimes these related
questions are what is most of interest.

The following chart provides some comparisons and contrasts of the types
of questions answered by predictive analytics vs. variable importance:

### Variable importance methods

There are a wide-range of methods for estimating VI.

These methods may be "model-specific" or "model-agnostic."

-   Model-specific methods are only implemented for a specific modeling
    approach.

-   Model-agnostic methods are more flexible and can be applied to any
    modeling approach

\
VI methods may also be "model-driven" or "parameter-driven."

-   Model-driven methods start with a predictive model and work to
    understand the predictive power of the predictors in the model.
    Model-driven methods for VI are either model-specific or
    model-agnostic.

-   Parameter-driven methods start with a target parameter and can use a
    variety of modeling approaches for estimation. Parameter-driven
    methods are always model-agnostic.

### Model-specific methods

As an example of model-driven VI, let's take regression:

-   In the context of regression models, VI is often assessed based on
    two main aspects: the size of the coefficients and the level of
    statistical significance, such as the t-statistic. It's important to
    consider the absolute values of both these measures.

-   The coefficients in a regression model are particularly informative.
    They tell us about the expected change in the outcome variable for a
    one-unit change in the predictor, while keeping other variables
    constant.

-   However, there are several limitations to be aware of:

    -   When variables are on different scales, comparing their
        coefficients directly can be misleading. One way to address this
        issue is through standardization, but this approach isn't always
        practical, especially when dealing with different types of
        variables.

    -   Multicollinearity, or the high correlation between predictor
        variables, can also pose a problem. It can make the estimates of
        the coefficients less reliable, as it's harder to isolate the
        individual effect of each predictor.

    -   Lastly, if your model includes interaction terms, interpreting
        the importance of variables becomes more complex. Interaction
        terms represent the combined effect of two variables, which adds
        an additional layer to understanding the individual impact of
        each variable.

This overview provides a basic understanding of how variable importance
is assessed in regression models and highlights some common challenges
you might encounter in this process.In the context of regression models,

### Model-agnostic methods

#### Permutation

-   A common approach to determining variable importance in models is
    the permutation-based method. This involves a few key steps:

    -   First, you train and validate your model to establish a baseline
        performance measure.

    -   Next, you permute, or shuffle, the values of one feature at a
        time. By doing this, you disrupt the relationship between that
        specific variable and the outcome.

    -   After permuting a feature, you re-evaluate the model's
        performance and compare it to the performance before the
        permutation. A significant change in performance indicates that
        the feature is important.

    -   You repeat this process for all variables in your dataset,
        assessing the impact of each on model performance.

-   This permutation method is quite flexible:

    -   It can be applied not just to individual variables but also to
        groups of variables.

    -   It's applicable across different modeling approaches, but the
        results may vary depending on the specific model used. This
        variation reflects how different algorithms understand and use
        the data.

    -   For example, in models like random forests, which are known for
        spreading importance across many variables due to their ensemble
        nature, you might see a more distributed pattern of variable
        importance. In contrast, regularized regression models might
        show dominance of one variable over others, especially if the
        variables are correlated.

-   There are also model-specific versions of this permutation method,
    tailored to fit the nuances of different algorithms. For instance,
    in Random Forest models, the permutation method takes advantage of
    the ensemble technique inherent in these models.

#### SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) 

SHAP is a sophisticated method used to determine the importance of
variables in predictive models. It is based on a key question: How much
does each variable contribute to the difference between a specific
prediction and the average prediction of the model?

The SHAP approach involves examining all possible combinations of
variables in the model, considering whether each variable is present or
absent. By doing this, it assesses how the presence or absence of a
particular feature influences the model's output compared to the average
prediction.

The intuition behind SHAP is to allow for a fair distribution of
contribution among all the features. It uniquely accounts for
interactions and dependencies among features, which can significantly
impact their contribution to the model's predictions.

To compute the SHAP values (or Shapley values), the method calculates
the average contribution of a variable across all possible combinations
of other variables. Here's how it works:

-   For each combination of variables that excludes the variable of
    interest, the model's prediction performance is calculated both with
    and without that feature.

-   The contribution of the variable is then determined by the
    difference in the model's predictions with the variable included
    versus excluded.

-   This process is repeated and averaged over all possible subsets of
    variables that do not include the variable in question.

The SHAP method provides a detailed and nuanced view of variable
importance, especially useful in models with complex interactions and
dependencies among variables. It helps in understanding not just whether
a variable is important, but how and why it influences the model\'s
predictions in the context of other variables.

These are just a few examples of a very large and often complex set of
approaches to defining and estimating variable importance.

Finally, as an optional extra reading, this paper conducts both
predictive analytics and variable importance and uses some clever
approaches for turning the results in to actionable insights for
