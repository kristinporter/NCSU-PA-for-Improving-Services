As you know, ultimately, after working through the entire PA workflow,
you will have a single predicted probability of the outcome for each
observation in your testing data, which was estimated with your final,
selected model/learner.

Based on the performance of the model/learner in your held-out testing
data, you will decide whether to deploy your model. We will discuss
deployment a little later.

First, there are some valuable questions you may ask to better
understand your test results (on new, held-out data) and your final, selected model. Answers to these questions can
help with decision-making aimed at improving services, and they can help
with explaining your model to stakeholders.

1.    How are predicted probabilities distributed across and within groups? 
2.    Who has low or high predicted probabilities of the outcome?
3.    What are the most important predictors in my model?
