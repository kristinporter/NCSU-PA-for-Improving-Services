title: "Adding and comparing learners"
---

Once we have specified our benchmark learner, we can specify additional learners for comparison. If simplicity and transparency are a goal, we will want to incrementally introduce complexity. For example, for our high school graduation example, we might take the following approach:

1.  **Incrementally add more measures to our predictor set.** For example:

2.  **Combine the predictor sets with different modeling approaches.** Here we consider whether different machine learning algorithms improve performance. We want to use knowledge about how the algorithms work when matching them with predictor sets. For example, some machine learning algorithms are better suited for large numbers of predictors than others. In our example, we might specify as follows:

| Predictor Set     | Modeling Approach                             |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Benchmark         | logistic regression                           |
| Expanded          | logistic regression, random forest            |
| Kitchen sink      | random forest, support vector machines, Lasso |
| Kitchen sink plus | random forest, support vector machines, Lasso |

This results in a total of 9 learners because we have a nine combinations of predictor sets and modelling approaches. Ultimately, we will then have 9 models that results from the modeling approaches.

Note: Machine learning algorithms typically require specifications for how they are implemented. These are called "tuning parameters." For example, the random forest algorithm has tuning parameters that include the number of decision trees in a forest, the maximum depth of the decision trees, and several more. Different values of tuning parameters have different implications for the performance of the algorithm. While the analyst can specify these tuning parameters, it is typically best to use a data-driven approach. We will dive more into this later. However, the point to take away here is that we will "tune" each machine learning algorithm for each predictor set. So when we ultimately compare learners, we are comparing "tuned" versions of them.

3.  **Compare the learners' in terms of predictive performance and bias:** This is a big topic which we will divide up across many of the following sections. Importantly, as we will turn to next, we want to compare learners' performance in **new, unseen data**. This is important because the goal of predictive analytics is to develop models that can make accurate predictions with new, real-world data that the model hasn't encountered before.
