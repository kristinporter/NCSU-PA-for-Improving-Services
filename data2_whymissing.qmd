title: "Overview of missing data"
---

It is rare for data to be complete for all observations and all variables. Missing data is a challenge for just about any data analysis. In R, missing data often looks like what we see in the following example. Here, missing information is indicated by `NA.` An analyst may indicate missingness their own way, but this would need to be translated to R's convention of using `NA`. Below, we see a missing value for the third observation's age and for the fourth observation's wage. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
# Creating a mini data frame with missing values
toydata <- data.frame(
  ID = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5),
  Site = c("A","A","B","B","B"),
  Age = c(25, 32, NA, 28, 40),
  Wage = c(16.50, 50, 20, NA, 40),
  JobRetention = c(1,0,1,0,1)
)

print(toydata)
```

Data may be missing for many reasons, including: 

1. **Non-Response**: When individuals respond to a survey, questionnaire, application, etc., some may choose not to answer certain questions due to the sensitivity of the topic, lack of knowledge, or other reasons. This can lead to missing values.

2. **Data Entry Errors**: Mistakes made during data entry can result in missing values. Data entry errors -  due to typos, misinterpretation of handwriting, or glitches - can also lead to nonsensical information that later gets converted to missing.

3. **Technical Issues**: Technical problems such as software crashes, network failures, or sensor malfunctions can lead to missing data points, particularly in real-time data collection scenarios.

4. **Privacy and Confidentiality Concerns**: In some cases, data might be intentionally omitted or masked to protect individuals' privacy or sensitive information. For instance, certain personal identifiers might be removed from the dataset.

5. **Skip Patterns**: In surveys or questionnaires, skip patterns are used where respondents are directed to skip certain questions based on their previous responses. This can lead to missing values for respondents who don't meet the criteria for certain questions.

7. **Data Collection Costs**: Collecting certain types of data can be expensive and time-consuming. As a result, researchers might prioritize certain data points over others, leading to missing values in less prioritized areas.

8. **Sample Bias**: In some cases, missing data might not be random but related to the characteristics of the individuals or entities being studied. This can introduce bias into the analysis if not handled properly.

9. **Data Migration or Integration**: When merging data from different sources or migrating data to a new system, compatibility issues might result in missing values or discrepancies.
