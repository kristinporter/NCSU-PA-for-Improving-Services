Lasso, which stands for "Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator," is a "penalized" form of regression.

*KH*: I think this could benefit from a few more sentences. For example, what are we penalizing?

In Lasso regression, the primary tuning parameter is $\lambda$ (lambda), which controls the strength of the penalization.

-   When $\lambda=0$, no penalty is applied, and the resulting model will include all predictors.

-   As $\lambda$ increases, the penalization effect becomes stronger, and more coefficients are shrunk towards zero.
    For a sufficiently large value of $\lambda$, all coefficients may become exactly zero.

-   The value of $\lambda$ can be selected with cross-validation with the training data.

*KH*: have you discussed cross-validation yet?

[**Advantages of Lasso**]{style="color:green"}

-   **Feature selection**: One of the key advantages of Lasso regression is its ability to perform feature or variable selection by shrinking the coefficients of the least important predictors to zero.
    This feature of the algorithm can be very helpful when you have a large number of predictors, and you suspect that many of them are irrelevant or redundant.

-   **Dealing with lots or predictors**: In situations where the number of predictors ($p$) is close to or exceeds the number of observations $n$, classical logistic regression might overfit or might not even run at all.
    Lasso can be a solution in these high-dimensional settings.

-   **Multicollinearity**: When predictor variables are highly correlated, standard logistic regression's estimates can be very unstable.
    Lasso helps to alleviate "multicollinearity" (high correlation) issues by penalizing certain coefficients and pushing them towards zero.

-   **Interpretability:** Because Lasso can zero out coefficients, the resulting model can be more interpretable than a model with many predictors. And Lasso is more interpretable than "black-box" machine learning algorithms.

-   **Model Performance**: If there's a concern about overfitting due to a large number of predictors, Lasso can provide a more generalized model that might perform better on out-of-sample data compared to a non-regularized logistic regression.

[**Disdvantages of Lasso**]{style="color:green"}

-   **True model:** If the true underlying model is very sparse (i.e., very few predictors truly matter), then lasso will perform very well.
    However, if a large number of predictors matter, lasso may not be stable.

-   **Challenged with highly correlated predictors:** With highly correlated predictors, lasso arbitrarily chooses which to include in the model. This arbitrary selection may not matter for predictive performance but can interfere with explainability.

**KH**: not sure if it's worth mentioning somewhere that logistic regression is the only approach that gives valid confidence intervals?  Maybe not given the goal is prediction, just a thought.


[**Implementation of Lasso in R**]{style="color:green"}

In R, we implement lasso with `glmnet()` in the `glmnet` package.
The code templates will do this for you.
