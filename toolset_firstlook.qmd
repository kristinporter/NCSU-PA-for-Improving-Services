When you first log in to https://patools.sprouthub.io, you should see R
Studio. It should look like this:

Notice the lower right quadrant in the above screenshot is showing
"files." Zooming in, we see:

Click on the `CDIPAtools` folder. Then you should see the following:

width="6in"}

Click on CDIPATools.Rproj. This will open the project. It will ask you
if you want to save your workspace. You never need to save your
workspace. Click "no." You should still have the same view of the files.
Next, open the `Notebooks` folder.

This is where you will find all of the notebook templates. For each of
the three notebooks, you will see the .Rmd and .pdf versions (the
markdown script and "knit" or compiled document.) You will also see an
.Rmd file called "Directions_for_Setup_All_Notebooks.Rmd," which
provides information about the "setup" sections across all the other
analytic notebooks. You have the option to reference this if you are
curious.

We will come back to this folder, but first, let's look at a couple of
other folders. If you go pack to the main `CDIPAtools` folder, you can
open the `data-r-objects` folder. You will see two subfolders: `inputs`
and `outputs`. You will upload your data files to the `inputs` folder.
That is, it is to this folders that you will upload your training data,
testing data, training metadata and testing metadata. Remember, this is
your own workspace, so you will not see other students' data files here.
However, you will see files that I have created for illustration. You
can just leave these alone and add your own files. The notebooks will
write files to the `output` folder, but you probably will never need to
access them. The notebooks will access and summarize the output files
for you.

Finally, if you again go back to the `CDIPAtools` folder, you can then
click on the `R` folder. You do not need to access any of the scripts in
this folder. However, if you are curious and would like to look "under
the hood," you can explore these scripts. The R notebook templates are
calling these scripts, which hold functions for implementing the
predictive analytics workflow. You will see the notebooks loading these
scripts in the setup chunks.
