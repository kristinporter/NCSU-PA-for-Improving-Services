title: "Harnessing the `tidymodels` package"
---

For implementing much of the predictive analytics workflow, we make use of the `tidymodels` package.

This all happens in the background. That is, you will not see calls to `tidymodels` because that is happening in the scripts within in the `R` folder. If you are curious to learn more about `tidymodels` and how to use related functions directly, there are many tutorials available online.

I will note that `tidymodels` often takes a different approach to predictive analytics than what I am teaching in this course. For example, while I am recommending doing data preparation as a separate, initial step, `tidymodels` has built in `recipes` for doing some data preparation as part of model training procedures. We ignore those features that do not apply to our framework. We instead harness the strengths of `tidymodels` and make it work for our framework. A key strength of `tidymodels` is that it standardizes output across a wide range of machine learning packages.
