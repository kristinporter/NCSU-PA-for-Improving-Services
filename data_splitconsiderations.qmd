INSERT DISCUSSION ABOUT DIFFERENT APPROACHES FOR TRAINING AND VALIDATING - E.G., TAKING OUT A SUBSET THAT IS AHEAD IN TIME OF TRAINING, USING JUST ONE LARGER VALIDATION DATASET.

INSERT REFERENCES TO PAPERS ON DIFFERENT METHODS CONSIDERATIONS?  SAY NONE ARE PERFECT.

REMIND BIG PICTURE. HOW MUCH DIFFERENCE DO SOME DETAILS MAKE? 

INSERT DISCUSSION ABOUT SAMPLE SIZES. ADMIT I DON'T HAVE GOOD ADVICE HERE BUT LIST SOME CONSIDERATIONS. 

NOTE WE WILL TALK ABOUT HOW TO COMPARE AND SELECT LEARNERS LATER.
