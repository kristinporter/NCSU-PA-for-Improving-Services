INSERT DISCUSSION ABOUT DIFFERENT APPROACHES FOR TRAINING AND VALIDATING - E.G., TAKING OUT A SUBSET THAT IS AHEAD IN TIME OF TRAINING, USING JUST ONE LARGER VALIDATION DATASET. ALSO MAKE POINT THAT CV COULD DESIGNATE TIME PERIODS AS FOLDS DOESN'T HAVE TO BE RANDOM. PREDICTING BACK IN TIME ALSO HELPFUL. INSERT REFERENCES TO PAPERS ON DIFFERENT METHODS CONSIDERATIONS. SAY NONE ARE PERFECT. REMIND BIG PICTURE. HOW MUCH DIFFERENCE DO SOME DETAILS MAKE? 

INSERT DISCUSSION ABOUT SAMPLE SIZES. ADMIT I DON'T HAVE GOOD ADVICE HERE BUT LIST SOME CONSIDERATIONS.
