In the code template for assessing our learner performance in testing
data, we examined the distribution of predicted probabilities overall
(with density plots). However, we can gain further insights by looking
at how predicted probabilities are distributed *within* groups and
*across* groups - whether different sites (schools, banks, store
locations, program locations, etc) or different demographic groups.
Insights about how predicted probabilities are clustered can guide
decisions about how to allocate resources.

The following plot shows how predicted probabilities of whether students
will drop out of school are distributed within a single school:

We can see that for this school, we have a balance of low-risk students
and high-risk, and we also have a lot of students for whom their dropout
risk is very uncertain (their predicted probabilities are in the mid
range, close to 0.5).

The following plot also allows us to look at how predicted probabilities
are distributed within schools but for many schools at a time.

NOTE THE Y-AXIS IS INCORRECT. I BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE NUMBER NOT PERCENT
AND WE DO NOT KNOW THE SCALE BUT THERE ARE CLEARLY LARGER AND SMALLER
SCHOOLS. For each school, we see three bars. The red bar indicates the
number of students in the school. who have a predicted probability of
dropping out that is less than or equal to 0.25. The yellow bar
indicates the number of students who have a predicted probability that
is greater than 0.25 but less than or equal to 0.75. And the green bar
indicates the number of students who have a predicted probability
greater than 0.75. This plot allows us to which schools have high
concentrations or high numbers of students with a high-risk of dropping
out of high school.
