It can also be valuable to flip the question about distribution of
predicted probabilities. That is, in addition to asking how predicted
probabilities are distributed within and across groups, we can look at
what groups are most or least represented within categories of predicted
probabilities.

For example, we might ask: Who has a high predicted risk of dropping out
of high school (e.g., those with predicted probabilities greater than
75%)? If we find that many of the students who are high-risk have high
absenteeism or low scores on reading tests, this may suggest areas of
focus for designing interventions to help these students. Note, at the
same time, we need to be careful not to assume that student
characteristics that are prevalent among high-risk students do not
indicate a causal relationship.

Again, data visualizations may helpful. Here is an example of a "mosaic
plot," which allows us to look at multiple characteristics at the same
time. This was created for the Titantic data set on Kaggle. It was
produced to understand who actually died or survived, but the same plot
could be created for those predicted to die or survive. And a similar
plot could be created to look at students predicted to have high risk of
dropping out or not.
