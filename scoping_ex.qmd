### A motivating example

Let's start with an example. This example is motivated by a project I worked on with a state Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) agency, but I've modified some details for illustration purposes. TANF is a federal assistance program in the United States that aims to help families achieve self-sufficiency by providing them with the necessary resources and services.

#### **The TANF agency came to my team with the following goals:**

1.  Could caseworkers better understand which clients were more at risk for adverse outcomes with a data-driven tool?

2.  Could we develop reliable risk scores that combine and weigh multiple risk factors into a single easy-to-understand number that can be incorporated into decision-making?

3.  Could trends in risk scores across the population of TANF clients provide new insights for program improvement and resource allocation?

#### **How do we scope a project that helps them achieve their goals?**

Here we will talk about scoping in terms of specifying:

-   How would information about clients' risks of adverse outcomes be used?

-   Who are the stakeholders?

-   What data are available?

-   What, *exactly*, are we trying to predict?

-   For whom would we be making predictions?

-   When would we be making the predictions?

Answering these questions allows us to move forward in planning a **potential** predictive analytics project. That is what I mean by scoping - what potential project could there be? But importantly, the next step is a to investigate that potential - to see if we can **reliably, clearly and fairly** make **useful and actionable** predictions. I refer to this next step as the "proof-of-concept," which we will turn to in the next section.
